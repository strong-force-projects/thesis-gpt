        - This is an MVP, there are many ideas for improvements.
        - This chatbot is **stateless** — it does not remember previous messages.  
          Follow-up questions may not be understood unless they’re self-contained.
        - The model **cannot interpret or retrieve images** from the thesis.  
          If a section refers to a figure, the assistant may describe its caption only.
        - It does best with **specific** questions, rather than broad **summarizing** questions. 
        - The responses are based entirely on the content of the thesis.
        - Code available [here](https://github.com/strong-force-projects/thesis-gpt).
